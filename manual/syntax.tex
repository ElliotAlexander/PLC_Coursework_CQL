\section{Syntax}
\begin{normalsize}
CQL is designed to replicate the expressive power of conjunctive queries, and as such the syntax can largely be mirrored in the language of \textit{conjunctive queries}. In this section we will expand on this relationship, in addition to exploring the syntax and briefly looking at some programmer friendly features within the syntax.

\subsection{Commenting}

Commenting is supported within CQL, with syntactic sugar offered with the dual style. Both \codeword{//} and \codeword{#} are acceptable commenting styles.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=framed]
// This is a comment
This is not

#This is also a comment
This is not
\end{lstlisting}
CQL also supports in line commenting. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=framed]
1,2,3 where A(1,2) and B(2,3) // This is an end of line comment
1,2 where P(1) and Q(2) and 1 = 2  # This is also an end of line comment.
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Formula Judgements}
Judgements are assertations in mathematical logic, in this case the occurrence of a free variable in an expression. \textit{Conjunctive queries} use formula judgements to list all free variables in an expression E, formally defined as:
$$ \overrightarrow{x} \vdash \varphi $$
Where $\overrightarrow{x}$ is a list of all free variables used in a program $\varphi$.  In CQL, this syntax is replicated with:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=framed]
x,y where P(x) and Q(y) = z
\end{lstlisting}
Where $x$, $y$ are free variables in the expression \lstinline!P(x) and Q(y)!. Note that equalities cannot reference free variables. For example, given the above example, $z$ cannot be included as a free variable (for example: \lstinline[style=framed]!x,y,z where P(x) and Q(y) = z!). 
\end{normalsize}
