\section{Introduction}
CQL (CQL Query language) is a domain specific programming language designed to implement the expressive power of conjunctive queries; a system of first order logic formulas which relation symbols, equality, conjunction and existential qualification, all of which are explained in more detail in \textbf{Section 3}. CQL is written in Haskell, and depends upon parsing/lexing tools Alex and Happy. This document will give a brief introduction to CQL, while expanding on some of it's features as well as it's inspirations in conjunctive queries.
